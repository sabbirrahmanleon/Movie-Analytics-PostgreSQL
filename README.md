# Movie Analytics — PostgreSQL


As a film enthusiast and data lover, I decided to combine both passions in this exciting project: Movie Analysis — PostgreSQL. I used raw SQL to extract insights from a movie dataset including financials, ratings, studios, languages, and more.

🧠 Key Analyses Included:

• Top-rated movies by IMDb

• Year-wise movie production trends

• Profitability calculations (% ROI)

• Studio comparisons based on average IMDb rating

• Bollywood vs Hollywood breakdown

• Language-wise total revenue

• Actor performance by number of movies and average ratings

• Custom filters like “All Thor Movies,” “Avengers,” and more!

📊 Skills Applied:

✅ SQL joins, filters, aggregations

✅ CTEs and subqueries

✅ Window functions and formatting

✅ Data storytelling using structured queries

💻 Tools Used: PostgreSQL and DBeaver

This project really helped me enhance my ability to write cleaner, scalable SQL queries while drawing actionable insights from diverse datasets.
